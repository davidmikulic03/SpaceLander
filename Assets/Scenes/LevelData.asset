  - sceneName: Sandbox
    description: 'This is the first, and also easiest, level. Well... It''s less
      of a level and more of a sandbox to familiarize yourself with the controls.
      The engine is incredibly efficient here, so you don''t really have to worry
      about your fuel. There are also fuel packages and repair packages scattered
      about if you need them.

  - sceneName: Loopy Luke
    description: "This level acquaints the player with the win condition; getting
      sweet points. The way you get points is by passing through Hoops\u2122, big,
      red, rotating loops. They're hard to miss, really.\n\nAlong with hoops, this
      level introduces collectible fuel packages, and repair packages. Losing Health
      makes you passively lose fuel."
  - sceneName: Tumbling Thomas
    description: "\"What? You can't do your job unless we're supplying you with fuel?
      Figure it out, bucko.\" \n\nBudget cuts from corporate are hitting hard."
  - sceneName: Faraway Fortune
    description: "Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No! It's a lovecraftian abomination!
      Corporate are calling it The Entity. They're currently trying to trademark
      it, but they need you to get close and see what happens. \n\nYou could just
      collect hoops as usual but that weird pulsating mass invites investigation."
