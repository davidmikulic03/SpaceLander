  - sceneName: Sandbox
    description: 'This is the first, and also easiest, level. Well... It''s less
      of a level and more of a sandbox to familiarize yourself with the controls.
      The engine is infinitely efficient here, so you don''t have to worry about
      your fuel. Have fun, and don''t forget to reset if you accidentally slingshot
      yourself out of the system (happens easily if you''re not careful).

  - sceneName: Loopie Hoops
    description: "This level acquaints the player with the win condition; getting
      sweet points. The way you get points is by passing through Hoops\u2122. A hoop
      is big, red, and rotating. It's hard to miss, really.\n\nThis level has a LOT
      of hoops. Good luck, Commander."
